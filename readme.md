# Volume Trading Bot for EVM Chains

## Overview

This bot is designed to simulate trading activity (volume generation) on any **EVM-compatible chain**, including:

* Binance Smart Chain (BSC)
* Ethereum Mainnet
* Base Chain
* Other EVM networks

It automates wallet creation, funding, randomized buy/sell operations, and optional fund gathering.

---

## Technology Stack

* **Languages:** TypeScript, Solidity
* **Type:** Automated Trading Bot Script

---

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Update the `.env` file with your wallet information:

```env
ETH_BASE_WALLET_ADDRESS="Your wallet address"
ETH_BASE_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY="Your wallet private key"
```

> **Note:** Default RPC endpoints in `.env` are public/free. For better performance, replace them with your own reliable endpoints.

---

### 3. Configure Bot Settings

Open `config.json` and adjust the parameters as needed:

```typescript
// Randomized trade amounts
export const amountMax = 0.003; // Maximum trade amount in ETH/BNB
export const amountMin = 0.001; // Minimum trade amount (must be > 0.001)

// Minimum fee balance to keep in wallet
export const fee = 0.001; // Recommended: â‰¥ 0.01 for more reliable transactions

// Randomized trade intervals (milliseconds)
export const maxInterval = 30000;
export const minInterval = 5000;

// Number of generated sub-wallets
export const subWalletNum = 20;

// Target blockchain
export const CHAINID: ChainId = ChainId.BSC;
```

ðŸ’¡ **Example Calculation**:
If `amountMax = 0.03` and `fee = 0.005` with `subWalletNum = 20`, your base wallet should have:

```
(0.03 + 0.005) Ã— 20 = 0.7 ETH/BNB
```

> Using a higher fee value (e.g., 0.01) can help recover funds in case of transaction errors.

---

## Running the Bot

Once configured:

```bash
npm run dev
```

During execution, a JSON file will be generated to store all generated wallet addresses. You can use this to withdraw funds manually if needed.
(An automatic fund-gathering feature can be added upon request.)
